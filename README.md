# Pong-2.0

This is all the code used for my Unity 20th Anniversary submission: Pong 2.0.

Controls:
Move your mouse up and down to move your paddle.

Press LeftMouseButton to pull the ball toward your paddle. (You'll know when it's off cooldown when you hear the little bell sound).

Press ESC to unhide your mouse.
